# 4- Super LSMC
Now that you understand how the LSMC method works, let's improve it until we get the SUPER LSMC method!

The LSMC is flexible and can work great, but it faces many challenges when one needs to apply this in practice and calibrate a model on observed option prices.
- Pricing one option is time consuming
- Need to price many options
- Need to "RE"-price many options for the optimization
- The optimization is noisy

It's a disaster!

But we solve all of this for you!
