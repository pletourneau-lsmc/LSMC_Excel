# 3.1 Small numerical example from Longstaff and Schwartz (2001)

Refer to the original paper

Longstaff, F. A., & Schwartz, E. S. (2001). Valuing American Options by Simulation: A Simple Least-Squares Approach. The Review of Financial Studies, 14(1), 113‚Äì147. https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/14.1.113 

Here, we showcase the small numerical example in an Excel file [3.1.1 Download the Excel file](https://github.com/pletourneau-lsmc/SUPER_LSMC/blob/main/3-%20LSMC/3.1-%20Original/3.1.1-Original_Excel.xlsx)
and then using [3.1.2 python](https://github.com/pletourneau-lsmc/SUPER_LSMC/blob/main/3-%20LSMC/3.1-%20Original/3.1.2-Original_python.ipynb)

Next, we simply improve by adding a loop instead of repeating for the two time steps [3.1.3 python with loop](https://github.com/pletourneau-lsmc/SUPER_LSMC/blob/main/3-%20LSMC/3.1-%20Original/3.1.3-Original_python_with_loop.ipynb)

## üîÑ Saving Changes Back to GitHub
Since Colab runs in the cloud, any changes you make won't automatically save to GitHub. To save your edits:
1. **Download the updated notebook** (`File ‚Üí Download .ipynb`).
2. **Manually upload it back** to your GitHub repository.
