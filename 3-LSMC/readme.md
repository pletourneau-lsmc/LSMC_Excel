# 3- Least Square Monte Carlo method

## 3.1- Original Small Numerical Example
Before diving into the complex stuff, you migth want recall the original small numerical example from Longstaff and Schwartz (2001). [More details here](https://github.com/pletourneau-lsmc/SUPER_LSMC/tree/main/3-%20LSMC/3.1-%20Original)

## 3.2- Add paths and time steps
Once you feel comfortable with the small numerical example, we can increase the number of paths and the number of time steps to get a more realistic example, while keep it simple enough to visualise what is going on.

Here, we will price a 1-year put with monthly exercise using 20 paths.
