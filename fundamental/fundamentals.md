### Least Square Monte Carlo method
Among the different methods allowing for pricing contingent claims with early exercise, the least square Monte Carlo (LSMC) method is the most flexible. 
The original method is not the most efficient, though. Our extensions that we developed through the years does make the LSMC method very competitive. We call it the SUPER-LSMC.

But first, let us look at the original LSMC method through the small numerical example from the original Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) [Small Example](https://github.com/pletourneau-lsmc/SUPER_LSMC/tree/main/fundamental/L-S_small_example)
